OP25 Hardware


To do software-defined radio, you will need:

an SDR “dongle” that will plug in to your computer or raspberry pi’s USB port.
The dongle will come with an antennae that will plug into it.
You can purchase one of several “SDR Kits” below for under $30 (The “kits” will include the dongle and an antennae)
Here are some example “kits”-

Nooelec NESDR Mini 2+ 0.5PPM TCXO RTL-SDR & ADS-B USB Receiver Set w/Antenna, Suction Mount, Female SMA Adapter & Remote Control, RTL2832U & R820T2 Tuner. Low-Cost Software Defined Radio. (Amazon-$24.95)

Raspberry Pi
-----

We used a 3 B+ successfully. We have instructions here about how to set it up.

We explored using a Raspberry Pi Zero. With a single core, it takes a few hours to compile and install. OP25 does run, but not very efficiently.

(So we decided to put pi zeros on hold as a target and focus on pi 3, and look at pi 2 and 4 as options first before going back to zeros.)

You can experiment with getting a bigger antennae. We experimented using a +5db 915Mhz antennas with hacked together connector and were able to get even stronger reception.

OP25 Software Stack

Our OP25 Code fork on Github https://github.com/AaronSwartzDay-SSP/op25
GNU Radio source https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio
Mac install: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/MacInstall
PC install: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/WindowsInstall
Debian package for testing: https://github.com/AaronSwartzDay-SSP/op25/tree/master/debian
The SDR Linux Distro for Raspberry Pi
A modified Raspbian image with the latest SDR software pre-installed and ready to go. Compatible with every Raspberry Pi.(Pre-built Raspberry Pi Image with GNURadio and these software radio tools: SDR Angel, Soapy Remote, GQRX, GNURadio, LimeUtil, and LimeVNA)Note: When you use this, you still have to compile/install op25, but this can be completed successfully and easily on pi3 with install script.

GQRX (During testing, we used gqrx to verify the dongle was working and to check for p25 traffic. This was *before* we started trying to use GNURadio w/OP25 installed.)
Gqrx is an open source software defined radio receiver (SDR) powered by the GNU Radio and the Qt graphical toolkit. Gqrx supports many of the SDR hardware available, including Airspy, Funcube Dongles, rtl-sdr, HackRF and USRP devices. See supported devices for a complete list. https://gqrx.dk/download
DragonOS LTS – an out-of-the-box Lubuntu 18.04 based x86_64 operating system for anyone interested in software defined radios. https://sourceforge.net/projects/dragonos-lts/
Docker install: https://github.com/lysol/op25-docker

In this photo below, we are just using an old rtl-sdr dongle with a wifi antenna (not optimal for frequency) and a pi3 b+, other dongles are btter/newer same chip though Realtek RTL2838
